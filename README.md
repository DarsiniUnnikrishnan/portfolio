## Projects

### Bus Delays in Toronto | Tableau
- Analyzed over 53,000 records of bus delays in Toronto using data from January to December 2022.
- Cleaned and transformed raw data, removing null values and irrelevant columns to improve dataset quality.
- Developed interactive Tableau dashboards to identify key delay trends, including the top routes and locations most affected.
- Discovered operator actions as the leading cause of delays and identified Kennedy station as a key hotspot for incidents.

### US Debt Tracker | Excel
- Analyzed Yearly Debt Percentage Increases, revealing an average growth of around 5% from 2016 to 2019, with a significant spike in 2020 due to pandemic responses.
- Identified historical trends showing the highest debt increases in January, February, November, and December, while the lowest increases occurred in April, May, June, and July.
- Projected that publicly held debt will grow from $25 trillion in 2022 to $33 trillion by 2027, indicating a steady upward trend influenced by recent economic challenges.
- Hypothesized that holiday-related consumer spending contributes to peak debt levels in the latter part of the year, while lower increases in mid-year months reflect a lack of major spending events.

### NYC Transportation | Excel
- Examined NYC transportation data to identify top causes for delays and breakdowns, finding that mechanical issues and heavy traffic were the primary contributors.
- Analyzed delay times across boroughs and bus companies, uncovering that certain boroughs and specific bus companies experienced notably higher delay times.
- Identified that delays and breakdowns were more frequent on specific days of the week, suggesting peak service issues related to travel patterns or operational factors.
- Utilized Excel’s data visualization tools and PivotTables to efficiently summarize large datasets, enabling clear and actionable insights for improving transportation service reliability.
